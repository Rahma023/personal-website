                    <h2>Marriage</h2>
                    <p>The gut feeling that Trevor expresses about Abel foreshadows the collapse of Abel's relationship with their family.
                        He describes his instinct through the metaphor of playing with a tiger cub, he states that he enjoyed being with Abel
                        the same way he enjoyed playing with a tiger the first time he went to a tiger sanctuary.
                        He said he liked it, he had fun with it but he never thought about bringing it in their home.
                        On the outside Abel was harmless his English name Abel has biblical origins, characterizing him
                        as the good brother and dutiful son which is how Abel appears on the outside. His name is what
                        people seem for and more commonly referred to like an innocent tiger cub is on the outside
                        Abel's Tsonga's name was Ngisaveni meaning 'be afraid'.
                        Tsonga is an ethnic and language group living in North-Eastern South Africa as Trevor described
                        it is extremely patriarchal where women must greet men with a bow nd in whatever limited social interaction that they have.
                        Men were expelled from the kitchen while women maintained the traditional role of cooking, cleaning,
                        and performing other menial tasks. For Patricia, Tsonga traditions heavily contrasted with her spirits.
                        Every man in Abel's village married a dosa wife while Patricia was a Xhosa woman notorious for their loud
                        mouth and promiscuous personalities, this is the basis for the turmoil within their relationship.
                        Abel's desire to belong and be respected by his people resulted in him trying to assert himself in their household. 
                        Later after being their marriage, they visited Abel's family which revealed patriarchal beliefs within the tribe culture thus 
                        created new tension and displays a clash of cultural beliefs. The tension between them continued to worsen with Abel's poor drinking 
                        behavior whereby he almost burned down their house trying to cook something and tried to hit Patricia twice.

                     <h2>Humor</h2>
                     <p>Trevor used humor to get out of difficult times or rather to get out of the darkest times of his life. When his stepfather Abel usually 
                         comes home while he was drunk, stumbling through the house, one night Trevor saw him pissing on the floor thinking that he was in the bathroom, 
                         not once but doing this many times when drunk. Trevor says 'That's how drunk he would get-he wouldn't know which room in the house he was'. 
                         He said this to console himself to get used to Abel's drinking behavour.</p>
